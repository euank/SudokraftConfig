===============

Some simple scripts for maintaining a minecraft server. Expect hackery to abound.

I'm not sure if this will go anywhere or not; for now it's not going to contain much since our configs aren't highly custom or done well. Eventually this will either be more or less abandoned or I'll get most of our configs added and a robust enough setup script to install our server setup from scratch
